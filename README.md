# Prosperity 2

My algorithms used for Prosperity 2, a virtual trading competition hosted by IMC.

**Final Rank**: 648th out of ~7,000 teams

## Round 1

For the first round, our team maintained a position of starfruit and amethysts 
based on how far the order price was from the average price of the good.

The manual challenge was completed by calculating the expected value of each
pair of bids, which was possible as the pdf was given as linear. The optimal values were
952 and 978.
